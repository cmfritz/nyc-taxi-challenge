### NYC Taxi Data Challenge
#### Catherine Fritz 

Please find below the links to my notebooks with my submission to the taxi data challenge. The notebooks are meant to walkthrough my thought process and explain the decisions or considerations I made. Also, if they are run in the below order, they it should produce all the same results my notebooks show.

1. [Optaining the Data](Download.ipynb) - This is the notebook I used to obtain the data. It is a massive amount of data, so it will take some time to run.
2. [Analyzing the Data](Analyze.ipynb) - This is the notebook where I started to explore the data and compile summaries.
1. [Visualizing the Data](Visualizations.ipynb) - This is the notebook where I created visualizations and table in order to draw conclusions on the challenge prompts.

Thank you for the opportunity to partake in this challenge, and please let me know if you have any questions at cmfritz0@gmail.com.
